LMS, the website;
built using django framework.
LMS is short for 'library management system'. This web app, as the name suggests, is built as an online management means
for an organisation to maintain the records of the books, the book issue requests and related due dates and renewals for
a library. This was built as a project while learning django through the official documentation and the youtube chanel of
@Corey Schafer (https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms).
This project was build in a total duration of 2 months, which is including the time off due to pursued academics, and
finally deployed on 17th March, 2022 using the service provided by heroku.

The website can be visited on "https://lms-on-django.herokuapp.com/"


Remarks:

Some users face issue logging in with their google account, as the website is not authenticated by Google, but implements
Google account login. Using an alternative browser, like Brave browser for instance seems to not give the same issue as of
now. Might not look into the matter for now because of the issue not being a major concern to me for the moment, I currently
do not look forward to have a large scale implementation.
